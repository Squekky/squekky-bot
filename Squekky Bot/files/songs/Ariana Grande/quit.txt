And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you."
But I wanna be in your arms

They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home."
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

When you said, "Baby, I just want you to lay me down and we'll fuck the pain away."
'Cause skin on skin, I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay

We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

I can't quit you
I can't quit you, oh baby
I can't quit you
I can't quit you, oh babe
Gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I'm gonna regret it
I'm gonna regret it
(Babe, babe)
Gonna regret it
I'm gonna regret it
