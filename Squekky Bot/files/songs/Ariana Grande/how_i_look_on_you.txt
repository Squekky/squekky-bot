Say you want me anyway, do ya?
You can handle all this fame, can ya?
Like me just the way I are
Just the way I wear out ya, ya

You would like me anyway, would ya?
You won't let me get away, won't ya?
Like me just the way I are
Say you don't wanna be a star, do you?

We step out on a Friday night
New front page, that's a cute headline
I made you a thing like, "Who's that guy?"
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight

Boy, I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for
Been on the low when it comes to love
Said do you like how I look or just
How I look on you?

Cover on the magazine in just 2 weeks
'Boy to Watch', ain't he just, just too sweet
Now he ain't even got time for me
I only see him on the big screen

Woke up at like 5 and boy, you wasn't here
When it's my fault she even knows that you're there
Was I just a transition?
Boy, remember where ya come from

(How I look, how I look on you, oh yeah)

How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you

How I look on you
