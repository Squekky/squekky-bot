[Future:]
I put that work on you everyday
When the night fall 'til the sun come
You done fell in love with a bad guy
I don't compromise my passion
You know what you do for me, I'm doing the same for you
I don't be tripping or making mistakes
I made too many in my past (that's right)
I fight for the things you believe in
I got your body and put it in drive, baby
Like I got keys in
We 'bout to take us a vacation
I'm 'bout to put all this vintage loving on you, baby
Like it was the late 80s
When you ride on me, baby rotate it
