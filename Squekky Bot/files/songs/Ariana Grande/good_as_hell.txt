I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on and dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going to the pool shit

Come now come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice lemme simplify
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
(Feelin' good as hell)
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Woo, girl need to kick off your shoes
Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you

(Thank God) 'Cause he better know my worth
There's so much that I deserve
But I ain't worried now, I'm 'a let my hair down
He been trying but not today
So girl, if he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

And do your hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Listen

So girl, if he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

And do your hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
(Feelin' good as hell)
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feeling' good as hell)
