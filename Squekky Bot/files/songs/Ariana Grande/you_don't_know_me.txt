Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
But there's just one thing
Dear
You think you know
But you don't have no
Idea
Think you know me
But there's more to see my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watched them all happen
But they don't understand
No
Thinkin' you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand
No

You want a perfect picture to believe in
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs is only
A part of the one I am, don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality and all I can be
Is in love with who I'm becoming

Think you know me but there's more to see my love
You think you know but you don't have no idea

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
You don't know me

I don't need to live by your rules
You don't control me
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes
You don't know me

And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life so truth be told
I see you thinking
But there's just one thing
Dear
And you think you know
But you don't have no
Idea
Think you know me
But there's more to see my love, my love
