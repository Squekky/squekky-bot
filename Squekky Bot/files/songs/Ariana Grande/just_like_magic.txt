Wake up in my bed
I just wanna have a good day
Thinking in my head
Then it happens how it should, aye

Twelve o' clock I got a team meeting
Then a meditation at like one thirty
Then I ride to the studio
Listening to some shit I wrote

Good karma, my aesthetic (Aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it, I finessed it (I finessed it)
Take my pen and write some love letters to heaven

Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it

It's like looking at my phone
But I'm tryna disconnect it
Read a fucking book
I be tryna stay connected

Say it's tricky at the top
Gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right
But I just send them love and light

Good karma, my aesthetic (My aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it, I finessed it
Take my pen and write some love letters to heaven

Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it

I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits
Just like magic, just like magic

Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it
('Cause I attract it, yeah)
